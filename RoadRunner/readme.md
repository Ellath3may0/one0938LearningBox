# RoadRunner

### Introduction
RoadRunner is a piece of software that utilises a variety of localisation methods as well as 
kinematics and a whole lot of math I don't understand to make your robot get from point A to point B
as efficiently as possible. This package preloaded here is a part of the RoadRunner quickstart for 
version 1.0 of the software. If you want more information on how it works, go to
https://rr.brott.dev. This website contains documentation and user guides for the software, as well
as installation and update tutorials. Use those, because I can't give a ton of advice on this stuff.
